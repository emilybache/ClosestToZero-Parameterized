Closest To Zero - Parameterize the tests
========================================

There is some code to implement the requirements (explained below). There are some unit tests. 
Refactor the unit tests to use Parameterized tests (also called Table Driven or Data-Driven tests).
Add more test cases and fix any bugs you find.

Closest to Zero Requirements
----------------------------

Given a list of integers find the closest to zero.
